      <h3>Galatians</h3>
      <section class="policy">
        <h4>Policy: Circumcision</h4>
        <p>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
          shall profit you nothing.</p>
        <p>For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a
          debtor to do the whole law.</p>
        <p>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
          justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</p>
        <cite>Galatians 5:2-4</cite>
      </section>
      <section class="doctrine">
        <h4>Doctrine: Faith & Works</h4>
        <p>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the
          works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</p>
        <p>He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
          miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the
          hearing of faith?</p>
        <p>So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</p>
        <p>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse:
          for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
          things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</p>
        <p>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it
          is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</p>

        <h4>Doctrine: Sexual Purity</h4>
        <p>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
          should abstain from fornication:</p>
        <p>That every one of you should know
          how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</p>
        <p>Not in the
          lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</p>
        <p>That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because
          that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned
          you and testified.</p>
        <p>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</p>
        <p>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath
          also given unto us his holy Spirit.</p>

        <h4>Policy: Head Coverings</h4>
        <p>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
          dishonoureth his head.</p>
        <p>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
          uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she
          were shaven.</p>
        <p>For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it
          be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</p>

        <h4>Doctrine: Gifts of the Spirit</h4>
        <p>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
          ignorant.</p>
        <p>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the
          Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that
          Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>
        <p>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</p>
        <p>And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</p>
        <p>And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God
          which worketh all in all.</p>
        <p>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
          profit withal.</p>
        <p>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
          the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</p>
        <p>To another faith by the
          same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</p>
        <p>To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another
          discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another
          the interpretation of tongues:</p>
        <p>But all these worketh that one
          and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</p>

        <h4>Policy: Submission</h4>
        <p>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the
          Lord.</p>
        <p>Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</p>
        <p>Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing
          unto the Lord.</p>
        <p>Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be
          discouraged.</p>
        <p>Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not
          with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;</p>
        <p>Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing
          that ye also have a Master in heaven.</p>

        <h4>Doctrine: The Nature of Christ</h4>
        <p>[The Son] is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
          creature:</p>
        <p>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are
          in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
          principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</p>
        <p>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</p>
        <p>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the
          firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</p>

        <p>One Lord, one faith, one baptism,</p>

        <p>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you
          even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:</p>
        <p>Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is
          in their shame, who mind earthly things.)</p>
        <p>For our conversation
          is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus
          Christ:</p>
        <p>Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned
          like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is
          able even to subdue all things unto himself.</p>

        <h4>Policy: Caring for the Widow</h4>
        <p>Honour widows that are widows indeed.</p>
        <p>Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years
          old, having been the wife of one man.</p>
        <p>Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children,
          if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saintsâ€™ feet, if
          she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every
          good work.</p>
        <p>But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax
          wanton against Christ, they will marry;</p>
        <p>Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.</p>
        <cite>1 Timothy 5:3,9-11</cite>
        <h4>Policy: Women in Church</h4>
        <p>Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</p>
        <p>But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over
          the man, but to be in silence.</p>

        <p>Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge
          of the truth.</p>
        <p>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
          man Christ Jesus;</p>

        <h4>Policy: Servant Subjection</h4>
        <p>Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
          please them well in all things; not answering again;</p>
        <p>Not
          purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the

        <p>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
          deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and
          envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
        <p>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
          appeared,</p>
        <p>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
          according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,
          and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>
        <p>Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
        <p>That being justified by his
          grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
